In this presentation we'll examine some of the \"code smells\" that make it difficult to write tests - and look at why they cause problems - before looking at the options available to make them testable.",

It was perfectly functional, but the UI wasn't the friendliest in the world and configuring jobs through a UI or XML files was just painful. In late 2016, Jenkins finally made it to version 2.0 which brought a huge number of improvements. From the new Blue Ocean UI to being able to define build configurations in your repo, it's a massive step up from version 1. In this talk, we'll go from an empty machine to a Jenkins install that automatically detects repos, branches and pull requests and builds them according to the Jenkinsfile in each branch. We'll be running tests, linting and packaging applications in parallel where possible, and even running things on Linux, Windows and MacOS all at the same time!",

In this presentation, I'm going to explain the concept behind internationalization, localization, and their benefits. I will show how culture influences the user's behaviour and why we need to do more than just \"making things translatable\". For example, I18N is also about date formats, text direction, meaning of symbols, and even humor. Internationalization has a massive impact on user acceptance and usability. I will highlight existing tools, interfaces, and best practices to get I18N right in the UIs we create and the code we write.",
